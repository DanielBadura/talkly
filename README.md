# talkly

This is just a small pet project of mine, aiming for small developer teams who like to gather talk suggestions, rate on them, comment on them and add slides to them once the talk has been held.

what the first version should deliver:

- rudimentary authentication/authorization mechanism (e.g. HTTP BASIC authentication, NTLM, ...)
- anyone can add new suggestions
- vote
- comment
- talks can be archived and additional info (slide, links, ...) can be added

As said before: this is not meant for everyone and far from stable, but if you like the idea and like to contribute or use it, go ahead.
